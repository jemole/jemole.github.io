  <h1>Jesús Moreno León</h1>
  <p>After more than a decade as a Computer Science teacher, I am focused on research in Computational Thinking (CT). Thus, I run <a href="http://programamos.es">Programamos</a>, We Code, a Spanish non-profit organization which promotes the development of CT from early ages, work on my PhD thesis on CT at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, where we develop <a href="http://drscratch.org">Dr. Scratch</a>,  work as a research assistant at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and collaborate with <a href="http://codeweek.eu">EU Code Week</a> as a Spanish ambassador.</p>
